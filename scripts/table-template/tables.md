# Tables

The script in this folder makes the xaml tables that are used in the `Classroom-Seating-Planner` solution and project. It makes writes the output to the `output.xaml` file.

This is a very temporary solution. Better solutions exist natively in C# and XAML. This is a quick and dirty solution to get the job done. Alternatively this could be done by hand so this seemed like a sensible option.

## Usage
Run
```bash
node .\scripts\table-template\main.js
```
Then find the output at `.\scripts\table-template\output.xaml`
