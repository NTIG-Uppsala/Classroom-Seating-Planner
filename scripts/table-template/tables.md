# Tables

The script in this folder makes the `XAML` tables that are used in the `Classroom-Seating-Planner` solution and project. It makes writes the output to the `output.xaml` file.

This is a very temporary solution. Better solutions exist natively in `C#` and `XAML`. This is a quick and dirty solution to get the job done. Alternatively this could be done by hand so this seemed like a sensible option.

## Usage

###### Pre-requisite: Node.js

Run

```bash
node .\scripts\table-template\main.js
```

Then find the output at `.\scripts\table-template\output.xaml`
