# File System Interactions

###### This project requires external files and folders to use. These files are generated automatically but can be manually changed.

## Changing Information Regarding the Data Files

-   To change where the data files are read from, change the value of `dataFolderName` in [FileHandler.cs](../Classroom-Seating-Planner/Classroom-Seating-Planner/src/FileHandler.cs) and [Utils.cs](../Classroom-Seating-Planner/Tests/Utils.cs).
-   To change the file names of the class list data file and classroom layout data file, change the values of `classListFileName` and `classroomLayoutFileName` in [FileHandler.cs](../Classroom-Seating-Planner/Classroom-Seating-Planner/src/FileHandler.cs) and [Utils.cs](../Classroom-Seating-Planner/Tests/Utils.cs).
-   To change the default class list that is created when there is no class list file, change the values of `defaultClassList` in [FileHandler.cs](../Classroom-Seating-Planner/Classroom-Seating-Planner/src/FileHandler.cs) and [Utils.cs](../Classroom-Seating-Planner/Tests/Utils.cs).
-   To change the default classroom layout that is created when there is no classroom layout file, change the values of `defaultClassroomLayout` in [FileHandler.cs](../Classroom-Seating-Planner/Classroom-Seating-Planner/src/FileHandler.cs) and [Utils.cs](../Classroom-Seating-Planner/Tests/Utils.cs).
